# Shelter app (final-project-CSC4330)
Final project for the course Software Development Systems CSC4330

## Short Project Description (what your project will do / solve)
FOR residents and families in coastal communities,
WHO need to find safe haven quickly and with certainty as a hurricane approaches,
The Shelter app is a web-app public safety service (mobile too?)
THAT provides a comprehensive and updated map of all available shelters, including vital details like wheelchair accessibility and capacity.
UNLIKE the FEMA or Red Cross apps, which only show a subset of officially partnered shelters,
OUR PRODUCT aggregates and verifies data from available sources like Shelter APIs, official social media, and user reports, ensuring to provide the most complete and up-to-date information when it matters most.
